# Interpreting Star Wars Survey Data
This project entails an in-depth analysis of an online survey (SurveyMonkey) pertaining to the Star Wars franchise. The survey data used was initially collected by FiveThirtyEight in 2014 and can be accessed directly via [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey). In this notebook, the following questions are explored:

- Which Star Wars movie do respondents consider the best?
- Which movies are the most watched?
- How does movie ranking and viewership vary according to:
    - Gender
    - Age
- In terms of character favorability:
    - Which character is the most liked?
    - Which character is the most hated?
    - Which character is the most controversial?

### Results
- *"Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"* was the most viewed and best rated film of the franchise
- The original trilogy (Ep. IV-VI) is considered better than the prequel trilogy (Ep. I-III)
- The majority of the fanbase consists of those who are less than 60 years old
